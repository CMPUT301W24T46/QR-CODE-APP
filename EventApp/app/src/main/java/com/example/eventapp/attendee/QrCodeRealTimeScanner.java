/**
 * QrCodeRealTimeScanner is an {@link AppCompatActivity} that facilitates real-time scanning of QR codes.
 * This activity is designed to use the device's camera to continuously scan for and interpret QR codes,
 * typically for the purpose of checking in attendees at events or for other QR code-based interactions within the app.
 *
 * <p>This activity is expected to integrate with a QR code scanning library or API that processes the camera feed,
 * detects QR codes, and decodes their contents. The specific implementation details for the QR code scanning functionality
 * are not included in this skeleton and should be implemented as per the requirements of the application.</p>
 *
 * <p>The layout associated with this activity, 'activity_qr_code_real_time_scanner.xml', should contain the necessary UI
 * components such as a viewfinder for the camera feed and potentially UI elements to display scanning status or results.</p>
